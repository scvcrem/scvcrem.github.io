abstract={How do the immigrant poor decide where to live? Sociologists have emphasized economic considerations to explain sorting between segregated and integrated neighborhoods. Drawing on 6 months of ethnographic fieldwork, 33 interviews, and 462 survey questionnaires collected in immigrant shantytowns in Italy, this article proposes that immigrants strategically choose between similarly marginal arrangements to maintain a positive sense of themselves. Most housing-insecure immigrants move between makeshift housing, acquaintances’ houses, and public shelters in an effort to ensure future stability. Others withdraw into shantytowns for the long term, giving up hopes of inclusion and finding worth in their ability to survive without support. Building, following, and adapting “shelter strategies” allows immigrants to meet basic needs while maintaining their self-worth, but it also constrains their location choices, which helps explain how extreme socio-spatial segregation emerges and continues indefinitely.}

title={Brokered Exploitation: Immigrant Farmworkers Navigating Unregistered Labor Markets in Italy},
author={Simone Cremaschi},
year={2022},
journal={Draft Coming Soon,},
abstract={This paper examines the relationship between brokerage and exploitation in the informal economy, arguing that scholars should broaden their focus from the worker-intermediary duplet to the employer-broker-worker triplet and consider how workers strategically decide whether to recur to brokers or not. Brokerage often emerges within an employer-worker relationship that is, per se, exploitative. The broker can either (1) amplify, (2) moderate, (3) mediate, or (4) monopolize the relationship. Drawing on ethnographic, interview, and survey data, I apply this framework to analyzing brokerage relationships within shantytowns housing immigrant farmworkers in Italy. First, I quantitatively evaluate the job market costs and benefits associated with broker-based job search. Then, I combine quantitative and ethnographic evidence to examine the workers’ decision making and show how the brokerage relationship can shift from amplifying exploitation to mediating it depending on external labor market conditions. Broadening relational understandings of exploitation, my study demonstrates that examining immigrant workers’ choices is crucial to understand how involvement in the informal economy impacts their lives.}

  abstract={Using unique Italian survey data on both documented and undocumented immigrants, we empirically quantify the correlation between different types of personal contacts and immigrants’ documentation probability, while also uncovering the contacts’ indirect associations via immigrant labour market outcomes (employment status and job characteristics). Our results indicate that contacts with both natives and family members have a positive and quantitatively large effect on immigrant documentation probability, conditional on a large set of covariates. Contacts with members of the same ethnic group, by contrast, increase documentation probability only moderately, an effect explainable by these co-ethnics’ association with employment probability. Moreover, our findings support the hypothesis that native contacts can connect immigrants with jobs that favour documentation.}

  abstract={This paper analyses microdata from three different sources in order to quantify the impact of the economic recession on undocumented immigrants in Italy and to compare their labour market outcomes in recent years with the performance of native workers and documented immigrants. This study documents for the first time a dramatic deterioration of employment outcomes and housing conditions of undocumented immigrants during the economic crisis started in 2008. In particular, the reduction in the share of employed workers is about three times larger among immigrants lacking legal status than among legally resident immigrants. Differently from what observed for this latter group, among undocumented immigrants the fall in employment affects both genders in a similar way. If immigrant workers are generally more vulnerable in the labour market than natives, the lack of legal status is associated with even higher exposure to the detrimental effects of economic downturns.
