  title={Outcast Society: Segregation, Exploitation, and Immigrant Life in Italy},
  author={Simone Cremaschi},
  journal={Prospectus Available upon Request},
  abstract={<i>Outcast Society: Segregation, Exploitation, and Immigrant Life in Italy</i> examines the social lives of marginalized immigrants in Italy, their segregation into self-built settlements, and their recruitment into unregistered farm jobs. Based on immersive fieldwork and a combination of original qualitative and quantitative data, I examine the functioning of the parallel society immigrant farmworkers have built within the unauthorized settlements known as  ``the ghettos.'' I find that self'segregation allows marginalized immigrants to survive poverty better. But this collective action plays divergent roles in the strategies immigrants adopt to confront life at the margins. Some immigrants spend short periods working in the ghettos and then try their chances in town, sleeping in precarious arrangements while looking for better opportunities. Others refrain from this search and withdraw into the ghettos on a long-term basis. The book demonstrates how these diverging strategies emerge from cost-benefit calculations and the need immigrants have to make sense of their condition. <i>Outcast Society</i> sheds light on the marginalizing processes that sustain globalized agriculture in one of the world’s wealthiest economies, whose high-quality food the world as a whole appreciates. But the implications of these findings travel far beyond Italy. The book allows readers to understand how residential segregation processes functional to global production emerge from complex individual choices and micro-interactions and expands our understanding of immigrant adaptation by illuminating the role of individual strategies.},

  title={Geographies of Resentment: How Public Service Deprivation Increased Populist Radical Right Support in Italy},
  author={Cremaschi, Simone and Rettl, Paula and De Vries, Catherine and Cappelluti, Marco},
  journal={Draft Available upon Request,},
  year={2022},
  abstract={Electoral support for populist radical right (PRR) parties is often linked to geographies of resentment with rural areas showing more support compared to urban ones. In this study, we argue that public service deprivation, defined as poor access to public services at the local level, increases the programmatic appeal of PRR parties. Public service deprivation signals to voters that public officials do not care about ``their community'' and makes them more susceptible to the rhetoric of PRR parties due to fears that poor access will be further crowded out by migrants. We examine our argument using three studies. We examine cross-sectional data from Italian municipalities (study 1), exploit a national reform forcing Italian municipalities below a certain population threshold to jointly share existing public services (study 2), and explore geo-coded individual-level panel data (study 3).  Our findings on public service deprivation and the meaning that voters attach to it helps us to better understand why PRR support is higher in some rural or urban areas, but not in others.}

  title={An Anti-Feminist Backlash? Female Labour Market Participation and Gender Conservatism in Europe},
  author={Rettl, Paula and Cremaschi, Simone and De Vries, Catherine},
  year={2022},
  journal={Draft Available upon Request,},
  abstract={This study examines how increased participation of women in the labor market affects egalitarian gender attitudes in society. We argue that increased female labor market participation might generate a <i>anti-feminist backlash</i>, because it triggers grievances for certain men and women. For men, increased female labor force participation intensifies competition in the labor market, especially among those who are already economically vulnerable (labor market competition channel). For women, increased female labor force participation might be also be threatening when they are not financially independent or married and thus worry about the employment of men in their household (household accounting channel). We test these conjectures in two studies. The first study uses European Social Survey data to show the relationship between increased labor market competition of women and more gender conservative attitudes. The second study outlines a survey experiment that aims to examine how being primed about the female labor force participation triggers labor market competition fears among men and women who are not financially independent or married. We conclude that increased labor market competition of women generated a backlash in Europe, but that this is not only driven by a male backlash, but also by certain women.}

   title={The Green Shades of the Storm: Exposure to Extreme Weather Increases Voting for Environmentally Unfriendly Incumbents},
   author={Cremaschi, Simone and Stanig, Piero},
   year={2022},
   journal={Draft Available upon Request,},
   abstract={Evidence shows that exposure to extreme weather events raises concern for climate change and increases pro-environment voting. But research also shows that exposure to natural disasters increases support for local incumbents who are able to successfully provide disaster relief. We examine the contrasting electoral effects of climate-related disruption by studying the aftermath of the 2018 Vaia storm in Northeast Italy, which destroyed about 42 million trees on an area of 41,000 hectares. Our causal identification exploits the stark variation in damage intensity between adjacent and closely similar municipalities. We measure exposure to the Vaia storm by combining satellite and georeferenced data on forest disruption, and blackout-related changes in nightlights intensity. We estimate its effect on voting behavior in the 2019 European elections within a difference-in-difference setting. We find that the storm significantly increased support for the local incumbent---the far-right League party in nine out of ten severely affected provinces---and did not generate positive electoral returns for pro-environment parties. Our findings temper the hypothesis that the increasing frequency of extreme weather events will increase support for policies aimed at reducing climate change.}

  title={``Resistance Then and Always:'' Civil War Legacies, Associational Spaces and Grassroots Mobilization against the Far-Right in Italy},
  author={Cremaschi, Simone and Masullo, Juan},
  year={2022},
  journal={Draft Coming Soon,},
  abstract={Can historical legacies of past civil conflicts help promote grassroots democratic processes? Can war experiences foster democratic participation beyond electoral and party politics? We explore these questions in Italy, a country whose democratic institutions were forged during a civil war fought between 1943--45 by an armed resistance movement against Nazi and Fascist forces. We argue that the presence and activity of the Resistance movement left legacies that make citizens more prone to mobilize political action to reject the advancement of the far-right today. Yet, while these legacies certainly work through the transformation of political identities and ideologies, we contend that these ideational dispositions translate into political mobilization via associational spaces. Associational spaces created by those who resisted play a crucial role in both keeping the legacies alive and coordinating political action. We empirically explore this argument by exploiting novel data from a recent nationwide, grassroots mobilization campaign -- the ``Anti-Fascist Law'' -- aimed at banning neo-fascist propaganda. To make sense of this campaign’s spatial patterns, we use an integrative multi-method research design that combines statistical analysis of all Italian municipalities, with within-case analysis and cross-case comparisons of purposively selected localities.}
