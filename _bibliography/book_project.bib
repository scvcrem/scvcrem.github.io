  author={Simone Cremaschi},
  abstract={<i>Exploited Community: How Immigrant Farmworkers in Italy Created a Parallel Society among Outcasts</i> examines the social lives of marginalized immigrants in Italy, their segregation into self-built settlements, and their recruitment into unregistered farm jobs. Based on immersive fieldwork and a combination of original qualitative and quantitative data, I examine the functioning of the parallel society immigrant farmworkers have built within the unauthorized settlements known as ``the ghettos.'' The extra-legal institutions they have built allow marginalized immigrants to survive poverty. But this collective action plays divergent roles in the strategies immigrants adopt to confront life at the margins. Some immigrants spend short periods working in the ghettos and then try their chances in town, sleeping in precarious arrangements while looking for better opportunities. Others refrain from this search and withdraw into the ghettos on a long-term basis. The book demonstrates how these diverging strategies emerge from cost-benefit calculations and the need immigrants have to make sense of their condition. <i>Exploited Community</i> sheds light on the marginalizing processes that sustain globalized agriculture in one of the worldâ€™s wealthiest economies, whose high-quality food the world as a whole appreciates. But the implications of these findings travel far beyond Italy. The book allows readers to understand how residential segregation processes functional to global production emerge from complex individual choices and micro-interactions and expands our understanding of immigrant adaptation by illuminating the role of individual strategies.},
