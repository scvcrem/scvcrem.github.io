title={Without Roots: The Political Consequences of Plant Disease Epidemics},
author={Cremaschi, Simone and Bariletto, Nicola and De Vries, Catherine},
year={2023},
abstract={Plant disease epidemics are becoming more prevalent due to climate change, monoculture and increased global connectivity, and inflict severe economic and social hardship on affected communities. To date, little is known about their political consequences. By exploiting the sudden and plausibly exogenous outbreak of the plant pathogen <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i>, which exterminated centuries-old olive groves in the Italian region of Puglia starting in 2013, we examine the political consequences of plant disease epidemics. We combine quantitative difference-in-differences analysis of municipal-level data with qualitative fieldwork in affected municipalities based on a novel case-selection procedure. We identify an excess vote share of 2.2 percentage points for far-right parties, document the outbreak's economic and socio-cultural consequences, and outline a mechanism rooted in a community narrative of abandonment by the state and ruling elites. Together, our findings reveal an important driver of support for the far-right.}

title={An Anti-Feminist Backlash? Female Labour Market Participation and Gender Conservatism in Europe}, 
author={Rettl, Paula and Bolet, Diane and De Vries, Catherine and Cremaschi, Simone
and Abou-Chadi, Tarik and Pardos-Prado, Sergi},
year={2023},
abstract={This study examines how increased participation of women in the labor market affects the distribution of egalitarian gender attitudes in society. We argue that increased female labor market participation might generate a anti-feminist backlash, because it triggers grievances for certain men and women. For men, increased female labor force participation intensifies competition in the labor market, especially among men who are already economically vulnerable (labor market competition channel). For women, increased female labor force participation might  also be threatening if they are financially dependent on men in their household and thus worry about the economic standing of men in their household (household economics channel). We test these conjectures in two studies. The first study uses European Social Survey (ESS) data from over 20 European countries to show the relationship between increased labor market competition of women and more gender conservative attitudes. By linking ESS data to electoral data, we also explore the consequences of such attitudinal change on vote intentions and behavior. The second study relies on panel data from Switzerland to better identify the mechanisms. We conclude that increased labor market competition of women generated a backlash in Europe, but that this is not only driven by men, but is also by women who are financially dependent on men.}

title={Self-built Segregation, Shelter Strategies, and the Immigrant Poor},
year={2022},
author={Simone Cremaschi},
abstract={How do the immigrant poor decide where to live? Sociologists have emphasized economic considerations to explain sorting between segregated and integrated neighborhoods. Drawing on 6 months of ethnographic fieldwork, 33 interviews, and 462 survey questionnaires collected in immigrant shantytowns in Italy, this article proposes that immigrants strategically choose between similarly marginal arrangements to maintain a positive sense of themselves. Most housing-insecure immigrants move between makeshift housing, acquaintances’ houses, and public shelters in an effort to ensure future stability. Others withdraw into shantytowns for the long term, giving up hopes of inclusion and finding worth in their ability to survive without support. Building, following, and adapting “shelter strategies” allows immigrants to meet basic needs while maintaining their self-worth, but it also constrains their location choices, which helps explain how extreme socio-spatial segregation emerges and continues indefinitely.}

title={Brokered Exploitation: Immigrant Farmworkers Navigating Unregistered Labor Markets in Italy},
author={Simone Cremaschi},
year={2022},
abstract={This paper examines the relationship between brokerage and exploitation in the informal economy, arguing that scholars should broaden their focus from the worker-intermediary duplet to the employer-broker-worker triplet and consider how workers strategically decide whether to recur to brokers or not. Brokerage often emerges within an employer-worker relationship that is, per se, exploitative. The broker can either (1) amplify, (2) moderate, (3) mediate, or (4) monopolize the relationship. Drawing on ethnographic, interview, and survey data, I apply this framework to analyzing brokerage relationships within shantytowns housing immigrant farmworkers in Italy. First, I quantitatively evaluate the job market costs and benefits associated with broker-based job search. Then, I combine quantitative and ethnographic evidence to examine the workers’ decision making and show how the brokerage relationship can shift from amplifying exploitation to mediating it depending on external labor market conditions. Broadening relational understandings of exploitation, my study demonstrates that examining immigrant workers’ choices is crucial to understand how involvement in the informal economy impacts their lives.}
