title={Underground Ethnic Community: Why West African Men in Italy Withdraw into Exploitative-Labor Camps},
year={2024},
author={Simone Cremaschi},
abstract={I investigate how access to an organized ethnic community shapes immigrant responses to exclusion. I draw on extensive ethnographic, interview, and survey data gathered among male West African farm workers living in large self-organized labor camps in Italy between 2015 and 2017. My fieldwork shows that when an underground community infrastructure is available, some immigrants use it as support while attempting to integrate into mainstream society. Others utilize it as a long-term shelter for withdrawal. I theorize a decision-making model and  provide evidence that withdrawal (1) is driven by barriers to mainstream society rather than returns in the underground economy, and (2) allows immigrants to compensate for unmet economic expectations with positive identification in the camp community. My study contributes to enhancing scholarly understandings of ethnic boundary-making, location choices, and labor exploitation among severely marginalized immigrants.}

abstract={Substantial advancements in gender equality, particularly for women in education, employment, and politics, coexist with a growing increase in support for conservative gender attitudes and far-right parties espousing such views. This study proposes a novel explanation for this gender backlash: men's personal grievances stemming from women's increased labor market participation. Termed the `feminization of employment,' this trend exposes men to heightened competition and wage penalties, leading them to adopt more conservative gender attitudes. We introduce an original shift-share instrument to measure exposure to increased female labor market participation across different industries and apply it to Swiss panel data. Our fine-grained panel analysis supports our argument, highlighting the gendered distributive consequences of women's labor market entry on men's attitudes towards gender, particularly in their personal lives. This study carries important implications, suggesting that the entry of women into the labor market may serve as a mechanism driving the growing gender backlash.},
