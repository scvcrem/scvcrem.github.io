  abstract = {What happens when a state fails to deliver adequate public services to its citizens? Building on the notion of a social contract, we argue that exposure to deteriorating public service performance creates grievances among affected citizens who as a result withdraw their support from established political parties and move towards anti-establishment populist parties. We examine this intuition in the British context, focusing on one the core aspects of public service provision in the UK -- the publicly-funded National Health Service (NHS). By combining government administrative panel data on local health care facilities closures with fine-grained geo-spatial panel data on public preferences and voting intention and using a staggered difference-in-differences design, we find that closures reduce reported patient satisfaction and increase support for populist right parties. Treatment effect heterogeneity further suggests that increased immigration and registrations of migrants at local practices exacerbate the link between declining public service delivery and populist right support. Our findings contribute to our understanding of the political consequences of public service provision and the rise of the populist right, demonstrating the role of deteriorating public service delivery in driving support for populist parties, especially in local areas undergoing rapid demographic change.},

  abstract = {The changing roles of women in the labor force represent a major structural transformation across advanced industrial democracies. How does this transformation shape political behavior? We argue that as women enter industries historically dominated by men, men experience heightened labor market competition that generates material grievances and fosters more conservative gender attitudes. Using variation in women’s and men’s employment across Swiss industries from 2001 to 2020, we develop a shift–share design linking national feminization trends to local exposure and combine it with longitudinal data from the Swiss Household Panel. We find that "industry feminization" reduces men’s employment and earnings and leads to more conservative egocentric—but not sociocentric—gender attitudes. In sum, men’s private grievances show little evidence of translating into broader political change, perhaps reflecting limited politicization of gender issues in this context. While labor market competition can foster gender conservatism, its political expression might be context-dependent.},
