title={Underground Immigrant Organization: Why West African Men in Italy Withdraw into Exploited Labor Camps},
year={2024},
author={Simone Cremaschi},
abstract={I investigate how access to an organized ethnic community shapes immigrant responses to exclusion. I draw on extensive ethnographic, interview, and survey data gathered among male West African farm workers living in large self-organized labor camps in Italy between 2015 and 2017. My fieldwork shows that when an underground community infrastructure is available, some immigrants use it as support while attempting to integrate into mainstream society. Others utilize it as a long-term shelter for withdrawal. I theorize a decision-making model and  provide evidence that withdrawal (1) is driven by barriers to mainstream society rather than returns in the underground economy or coercion by exploitative agents, and (2) allows immigrants to compensate for unmet economic expectations with positive identification in the camp community. My study contributes to enhancing scholarly understandings of ethnic boundary-making, location choices, and labor exploitation among severely marginalized immigrants.}

title={Public Service Delivery and Support for the Populist Right: Evidence from the British National Health Service}, 
author={Dickson, Zachary P. and Hobolt, Sara B. and De Vries, Catherine E. and Cremaschi, Simone},
year={2024},
abstract={What happens when a state fails to deliver adequate public services to its citizens? Building on the notion of a social contract, we argue that exposure to deteriorating public service performance creates grievances among affected citizens who as a result withdraw their support from established political parties and move towards anti-establishment populist parties. We examine this intuition in the British context, focusing on one the core aspects of public service provision in the UK -- the publicly-funded National Health Service (NHS). By combining government administrative panel data on local health care facilities closures with fine-grained geo-spatial panel data on public preferences and voting intention and using a staggered difference-in-differences design, we find that closures reduce reported patient satisfaction and increase support for populist right parties. Treatment effect heterogeneity further suggests that increased immigration and registrations of migrants at local practices exacerbate the link between declining public service delivery and populist right support. Our findings contribute to our understanding of the political consequences of public service provision and the rise of the populist right, demonstrating the role of deteriorating public service delivery in driving support for populist parties, especially in local areas undergoing rapid demographic change.}

title={A Gender Backlash? How Exposure to Female Labor Market Participation Fuels Gender Conservatism}, 
author={Rettl, Paula and Bolet, Diane and De Vries, Catherine E. and Cremaschi, Simone
and Abou-Chadi, Tarik and Pardos-Prado, Sergi},
year={2023},
abstract={Substantial advancements in gender equality, particularly for women in education, employment, and politics, coexist with a growing increase in support for conservative gender attitudes and far-right parties espousing such views. This study proposes a novel explanation for this gender backlash: men's personal grievances stemming from women's increased labor market participation. Termed the `feminization of employment,' this trend exposes men to heightened competition and wage penalties, leading them to adopt more conservative gender attitudes. We introduce an original shift-share instrument to measure exposure to increased female labor market participation across different industries and apply it to Swiss panel data. Our fine-grained panel analysis supports our argument, highlighting the gendered distributive consequences of women's labor market entry on men's attitudes towards gender, particularly in their personal lives. This study carries important implications, suggesting that the entry of women into the labor market may serve as a mechanism driving the growing gender backlash.}
