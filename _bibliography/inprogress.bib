  abstract = {What happens when a state fails to deliver adequate public services to its citizens? Building on the notion of a social contract, we argue that exposure to deteriorating public service performance creates grievances among affected citizens who as a result withdraw their support from established political parties and move towards anti-establishment populist parties. We examine this intuition in the British context, focusing on one the core aspects of public service provision in the UK -- the publicly-funded National Health Service (NHS). By combining government administrative panel data on local health care facilities closures with fine-grained geo-spatial panel data on public preferences and voting intention and using a staggered difference-in-differences design, we find that closures reduce reported patient satisfaction and increase support for populist right parties. Treatment effect heterogeneity further suggests that increased immigration and registrations of migrants at local practices exacerbate the link between declining public service delivery and populist right support. Our findings contribute to our understanding of the political consequences of public service provision and the rise of the populist right, demonstrating the role of deteriorating public service delivery in driving support for populist parties, especially in local areas undergoing rapid demographic change.},

  abstract = {The growing participation of women in the labor market has marked a significant societal transformation, coinciding with the rise of gender conservatism and far-right support. We study whether the economic consequences of labor market feminization and gender backlash are causally connected beyond other well-known factors, such as cultural change. Using Swiss panel data and a novel shift-share instrument measuring menâ€™s exposure to changes in the gender composition of the labor force across industries (labor market feminization), we make two contributions. First, labor market feminization negatively affects men's income and employment prospects, making men more conservative in their gender attitudes. Second, while labor market feminization affects gender attitudes within the private sphere, in a context of low politicization of gender by political elites, it does not influence broader political outcomes like policy preferences or far-right voting. These findings reveal the sequence and mechanisms behind the distributional consequences of labor market feminization.},
