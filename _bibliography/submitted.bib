    title={The Political Legacies of Wartime Resistance: How Local Communities in Italy Keep Anti-fascist Sentiments Alive},
  author={Simone Cremaschi and Juan Masullo},
  journal={UNU-WIDER Working Paper},
  abstract={Can past wartime experiences other than violence have long-term effects on political attitudes and behaviours? How are these legacies sustained across generations and beyond those who directly experienced war? We explore these questions in Italy, a country whose democratic institutions were forged after a civil war (1943–45) fought between an armed resistance movement
  and Nazi–Fascist forces. We argue that local experiences of resistance left anti-fascist legacies that can be translated into contemporary political action. We detail a process of community-based intergenerational transmission linking past wartime experiences and recent political outcomes consisting of three core activities—memorialization, localization, and mobilization—put forward by memory entrepreneurs. To empirically substantiate this argument, we use a multi-method design that combines a statistical analysis of original georeferenced data across Italian municipalities and a within-case analysis of a purposely selected locality. Our study advances the growing literature on the long-term political legacies of war by improving our understanding of the processes and mechanisms underlying the transmission of political memories over time and across generations. Moreover, it emphasizes armed resistance as a critical source of war’s long-term political legacies and explores political effects beyond electoral and party politics.},

@article{vaia,
    title={Disaster Relief Trumps Demand for Environmental Policy},
  author={Simone Cremaschi and Piero Stanig},
  journal={OSF Preprint},
  abstract={We empirically assess  two contrasting predictions that disasters related to climate change raise support for (1) environmentalist parties and (2) incumbents that successfully provide disaster relief. We study the electoral effects of Vaia, a devastating storm that hit the mountainous area of northeast Italy in 2018. We measure the storm's material consequences combining satellite and georeferenced data on forest disruption, blackout-related changes in nightlights intensity, and damage relief, and exploit the stark variation in damage intensity between adjacent and closely similar municipalities in a stringent difference-in-differences design. The storm significantly increased support for the regional incumbent---the radical-right Lega in most affected provinces---and did not generate positive electoral returns for parties with environmentalist platforms. More research is needed to understand under which conditions exposure to extreme weather events activates support for environmentalist policy.},

@article{public_services,
    title={Geographies of Discontent: How Public Service Deprivation Increased Far-Right Support in Italy},
  author={Cremaschi, Simone and Rettl, Paula and Cappelluti, Marco and De Vries, Catherine},
  journal={OSF Preprint},
  abstract={Electoral support for far-right parties is often linked to specific geographies of discontent. We argue that public service deprivation, defined as poor access to public services at the local level, helps explain these patterns in far-right support. Public service deprivation increases the appeal of far-right parties by making people more worried about immigration and increased competition for reduced public services. We examine our argument using three studies from Italy, a country home to some of the most electorally successful far-right parties in the past decades. We examine cross-sectional data from municipalities (study 1), exploit a national reform forcing municipalities below a certain population threshold to jointly share local public services (study 2), and explore geo-coded individual-level election survey data (study 3). Our findings suggest that public service deprivation helps us better understand geographical differences in far-right support and the mechanisms underlying it.},
