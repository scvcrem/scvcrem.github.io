title={Without Roots: The Political Consequences of Plant Disease Epidemics},
author={Cremaschi, Simone and Bariletto, Nicola and De Vries, Catherine},
year={2023},
abstract={Plant disease epidemics are becoming more prevalent due to climate change, monoculture, and increased global connectivity, and inflict severe economic and social hardship on affected communities. Yet, little is known about their political consequences. We exploit the sudden and plausibly exogenous outbreak of the plant pathogen <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i>, which exterminated centuries-old olive groves in the Italian region of Puglia starting in 2013, to examine the political consequences of plant disease epidemics. We combine quantitative difference-in-differences analysis of municipal-level data with qualitative fieldwork in affected municipalities using a novel case selection procedure. We find a 2.2-percentage-point excess vote share for far-right parties, document the outbreak's economic and socio-cultural consequences, and outline a mechanism rooted in a community narrative of abandonment by the state and ruling elites. Together, our findings reveal an important driver of support for the far right},

    title={Geographies of Discontent: Public Service Deprivation and the Rise of the Far Right in Italy},
  author={Cremaschi, Simone and Rettl, Paula and Cappelluti, Marco and De Vries, Catherine},
  journal={OSF Preprint},
  abstract={Electoral support for far-right parties is often linked to geographies of discontent. We argue that public service deprivation, defined as reduced access to public services at the local level, plays an important role in explaining these patterns. By exploiting an Italian reform that reduced access to local public services in municipalities with fewer than 5,000 residents we demonstrate that far-right support in national elections increased more after the reform in affected municipalities than in unaffected ones. We use geo-coded individual-level survey data and party rhetoric data to explore the mechanisms underlying this result. Our findings suggest that exposure to the reform increased concerns about immigration, and that far-right parties increasingly linked public services to immigration in their rhetoric after the reform. These demand and supply dynamics help us understand how public service deprivation shapes geographic patterns in far-right support.},

    title={The Political Legacies of Wartime Resistance: How Local Communities in Italy Keep Anti-fascist Sentiments Alive},
  author={Simone Cremaschi and Juan Masullo},
  journal={UNU-WIDER Working Paper},
  abstract={Can past wartime experiences other than violence have long-term effects on political attitudes and behaviours? How are these legacies sustained across generations and beyond those who directly experienced war? We explore these questions in Italy, a country whose democratic institutions were forged after a civil war (1943–45) fought between an armed resistance movement
  and Nazi-Fascist forces. We argue that local experiences of resistance left anti-fascist legacies that can be translated into contemporary political action. We detail a process of community-based intergenerational transmission linking past wartime experiences and recent political outcomes consisting of three core activities—memorialization, localization, and mobilization—put forward by memory entrepreneurs. To empirically substantiate this argument, we use a multi-method design that combines a statistical analysis of original georeferenced data across Italian municipalities and a within-case analysis of a purposely selected locality. Our study advances the growing literature on the long-term political legacies of war by improving our understanding of the processes and mechanisms underlying the transmission of political memories over time and across generations. Moreover, it emphasizes armed resistance as a critical source of war's long-term political legacies and explores political effects beyond electoral and party politics.},

@article{vaia,
    title={Disaster Relief Trumps Demand for Environmental Policy},
  author={Simone Cremaschi and Piero Stanig},
  journal={OSF Preprint},
  abstract={We empirically assess  two contrasting predictions that disasters related to climate change raise support for (1) environmentalist parties and (2) incumbents that successfully provide disaster relief. We study the electoral effects of Vaia, a devastating storm that hit the mountainous area of northeast Italy in 2018. We measure the storm's material consequences combining satellite and georeferenced data on forest disruption, blackout-related changes in nightlights intensity, and damage relief, and exploit the stark variation in damage intensity between adjacent and closely similar municipalities in a stringent difference-in-differences design. The storm significantly increased support for the regional incumbent---the radical-right Lega in most affected provinces---and did not generate positive electoral returns for parties with environmentalist platforms. More research is needed to understand under which conditions exposure to extreme weather events activates support for environmentalist policy.},
