title={Sheltered from Exclusion: Ethnic Boundary Making and Underground Immigrant Organization in the Italian Farmlands},
journal={Article},
year={2024},
author={Simone Cremaschi},
abstract={I explore how immigrants respond to exclusion from basic resources and services, delving into the role of informality. I argue that informality expands immigrants' adaptation strategies by providing an underground space for community organization. I outline a decision-making model to explain why some immigrants my use an underground community infrastructure for support while attempting to assimilate, while others as a shelter to withdraw. I draw on extensive ethnographic, interview, and survey data from West African farm workers living in large self-organized immigrant camps in the Italian farmlands (2015-17). The perception of insurmountable barriers to assimilation, manifested in the lack of residence permit, employment, and supportive contacts, drives immigrants underground. Social recognition gained by those who choose to withdraw and survive independently compensates for potential losses in economic opportunities inherent in this choice. This study contributes to our understanding of ethnic boundary-making in severely marginalized immigrant groups.}

title={An Anti-Feminist Backlash? Female Labour Market Participation and Gender Conservatism in Europe}, 
journal={Article},
author={Rettl, Paula and Bolet, Diane and De Vries, Catherine and Cremaschi, Simone and Abou-Chadi, Tarik and Pardos-Prado, Sergi},
year={2023},
abstract={This study examines how increased participation of women in the labor market affects the distribution of egalitarian gender attitudes in society. We argue that increased female labor market participation might generate a anti-feminist backlash, because it triggers grievances for certain men and women. For men, increased female labor force participation intensifies competition in the labor market, especially among men who are already economically vulnerable (labor market competition channel). For women, increased female labor force participation might  also be threatening if they are financially dependent on men in their household and thus worry about the economic standing of men in their household (household economics channel). We test these conjectures in two studies. The first study uses European Social Survey (ESS) data from over 20 European countries to show the relationship between increased labor market competition of women and more gender conservative attitudes. By linking ESS data to electoral data, we also explore the consequences of such attitudinal change on vote intentions and behavior. The second study relies on panel data from Switzerland to better identify the mechanisms. We conclude that increased labor market competition of women generated a backlash in Europe, but that this is not only driven by men, but is also by women who are financially dependent on men.}

title={Public Service Deprivation and Political Discontent},
author={Dickson, Zachary P. and Hobolt, Sara B. and De Vries, Catherine and Cremaschi, Simone},
journal={Article},
abstract={Governments play a crucial role in providing essential public services. Yet, our understanding of how public service deprivation shape political attitudes and behaviors in established democracies is still limited. Given that public services are often the primary means through which citizens interact with the state, public service deprivation has the potential to create grievances that reduce trust in political institutions while increasing the appeal of populist parties and policy solutions. We examine this empirically in the British context, focusing on one the core aspects of public service provision in the UK -- the publicly-funded National Health Service (NHS), which is free to the public at the point of care. We argue that localized cuts in public services caused increases support for populist parties and polices.  Combining government administrative panel data on public service performance with fine-grained geo-spatial panel data on public preferences and voting intention, we apply a staggered difference-in-differences design to show support for our argument. Our findings illustrate the corrosive effects of public service deprivation, revealing decreased public trust and satisfaction with political institutions and increased support for radical right-wing populist parties.}
