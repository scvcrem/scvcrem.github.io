title={Without Roots: The Political Consequences of Plant Disease Epidemics},
author={Cremaschi, Simone and Bariletto, Nicola and De Vries, Catherine},

abstract={Plant disease epidemics are becoming more prevalent due to climate change, monoculture, and global connectivity, and inflict severe economic and social hardship on affected communities. Little is known about their political consequences. We exploit the sudden outbreak of the plant pathogen <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i>, which exterminated centuries-old olive groves in the Italian region of Puglia, and examine its political consequences. We combine quantitative difference-in-differences analysis of municipal-level data with qualitative fieldwork in affected municipalities using a novel case selection procedure. We find a 2.2-percentage-point excess vote share for far-right parties, document the economic and socio-cultural hardship associated with the outbreak, and how its electoral effect is moderated by pre-existing public service deprivation and a community narrative of being left behind by the state. These findings shed new light on the political consequences of economic shocks, by showing how they interact with existing conditions within affected communities.},
