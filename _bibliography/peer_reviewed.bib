  abstract={Using unique Italian survey data on both documented and undocumented immigrants, we empirically quantify the correlation between different types of personal contacts and immigrants’ documentation probability, while also uncovering the contacts’ indirect associations via immigrant labour market outcomes (employment status and job characteristics). Our results indicate that contacts with both natives and family members have a positive and quantitatively large effect on immigrant documentation probability, conditional on a large set of covariates. Contacts with members of the same ethnic group, by contrast, increase documentation probability only moderately, an effect explainable by these co-ethnics’ association with employment probability. Moreover, our findings support the hypothesis that native contacts can connect immigrants with jobs that favour documentation.}

  abstract={This paper analyses microdata from three different sources in order to quantify the impact of the economic recession on undocumented immigrants in Italy and to compare their labour market outcomes in recent years with the performance of native workers and documented immigrants. This study documents for the first time a dramatic deterioration of employment outcomes and housing conditions of undocumented immigrants during the economic crisis started in 2008. In particular, the reduction in the share of employed workers is about three times larger among immigrants lacking legal status than among legally resident immigrants. Differently from what observed for this latter group, among undocumented immigrants the fall in employment affects both genders in a similar way. If immigrant workers are generally more vulnerable in the labour market than natives, the lack of legal status is associated with even higher exposure to the detrimental effects of economic downturns.
