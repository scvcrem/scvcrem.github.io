Exploiting the sudden onset of a plant disease epidemic in Puglia, Italy—where the plant pathogen <i>Xylella fastidiosa</i> devastated centuries-old olive groves—we explore the collective effects of economic shocks. By combining quantitative difference-in-differences analysis of municipal data with a novel case selection strategy for qualitative fieldwork, we document the hardship caused by the outbreak, and estimate a 2.2-percentage-point increase in far-right vote share. We show that pre-existing public service deprivation moderates the shock’s political consequences through a community narrative of state neglect. These findings highlight that pre-existing community conditions shape the political consequences of economic shocks, and that plant disease epidemics—which are becoming more prevalent due to climate change—have important political effects.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="public_services" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">Geographies of Discontent: Public Service Deprivation and the Rise of the Far Right in Italy</div> <div class="author"> <em>Simone Cremaschi</em>, Paula Rettl, Marco Cappelluti, and Catherine E.

We argue that public service deprivation, defined as reduced access to public services, plays an important role in explaining these patterns. By exploiting an Italian reform that reduced access to public services in municipalities with fewer than 5,000 residents, we show that far-right support in national elections increased in municipalities affected by the reform compared to unaffected ones. We use geo-coded individual-level survey data and party rhetoric data to explore the mechanisms underlying this result. Our findings suggest that concerns about immigration are exacerbated by the reform, and that far-right parties increasingly linked public services to immigration in their rhetoric after the reform. These demand and supply dynamics help us understand how public service deprivation shapes geographic patterns in far-right support.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="vaia" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">Voting and Climate Change: How an Extreme Weather Event Increased Support for a Radical-Right Incumbent in Italy</div> <div class="author"> <em>Simone Cremaschi</em>, and Piero Stanig </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Journal of Politics</em>, Conditionally Accepted , 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="https://osf.io/jknqb/" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Preprint</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>We empirically assess two contrasting predictions that disasters related to climate change raise support for (1) environmentalist parties and (2) incumbents that successfully provide disaster relief.

We measure the storm’s material consequences combining satellite and georeferenced data on forest disruption, blackout-related changes in nightlights intensity, and damage relief, and exploit the stark variation in damage intensity between adjacent and closely similar municipalities in a stringent difference-in-differences design. The storm significantly increased support for the regional incumbent – the radical-right Lega in most affected provinces – and did not generate positive electoral returns for parties with environmentalist platforms.

We argue that local experiences of armed resistance leave political legacies that “memory entrepreneurs” can translate into contemporary political action via a community-based process of intergenerational transmission consisting of three core activities – memorialization, localization, and mobilization. We empirically substantiate this argument in Italy, where an intense armed resistance movement against Nazi-Fascist forces took place in the 1940s. We combine statistical analysis of original data across Italian municipalities and within-case analysis of a purposively selected locality to show how the past impacts the present via the preservation and activation of collective memories. This study improves our understanding of the processes of long-term transmission, emphasizes armed resistance as a critical source of the long-term political legacies of war, and explores its political effects beyond electoral and party politics.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="cremaschiDevillanova2020" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">Immigrants and Legal Status: Do Personal Contacts Matter?</div> <div class="author"> <em>Simone Cremaschi</em>, and Carlo Devillanova </div> <div class="periodical"> <em>Population, Space and Place</em>, 2020 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> <a href="/assets/pdf/calabria.pdf" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Preprint</a> <a href="https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/psp.2383" class="btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Publisher</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>Using unique Italian survey data on both documented and undocumented immigrants, we empirically quantify the correlation between different types of personal contacts and immigrants’ documentation probability, while also uncovering the contacts’ indirect associations via immigrant labour market outcomes (employment status and job characteristics).

This study documents for the first time a dramatic deterioration of employment outcomes and housing conditions of undocumented immigrants during the economic crisis started in 2008. In particular, the reduction in the share of employed workers is about three times larger among immigrants lacking legal status than among legally resident immigrants. Differently from what observed for this latter group, among undocumented immigrants the fall in employment affects both genders in a similar way. If immigrant workers are generally more vulnerable in the labour market than natives, the lack of legal status is associated with even higher exposure to the detrimental effects of economic downturns.

Building on the notion of a social contract, we argue that exposure to deteriorating public service performance creates grievances among affected citizens who as a result withdraw their support from established political parties and move towards anti-establishment populist parties. We examine this intuition in the British context, focusing on one the core aspects of public service provision in the UK – the publicly-funded National Health Service (NHS). By combining government administrative panel data on local health care facilities closures with fine-grained geo-spatial panel data on public preferences and voting intention and using a staggered difference-in-differences design, we find that closures reduce reported patient satisfaction and increase support for populist right parties. Treatment effect heterogeneity further suggests that increased immigration and registrations of migrants at local practices exacerbate the link between declining public service delivery and populist right support. Our findings contribute to our understanding of the political consequences of public service provision and the rise of the populist right, demonstrating the role of deteriorating public service delivery in driving support for populist parties, especially in local areas undergoing rapid demographic change.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="male_backlash" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">A Gender Backlash: Does Exposure to Female Labor Market Participation Fuel Gender Conservatism?</div> <div class="author"> Paula Rettl, Diane Bolet, Catherine E.

We study whether the economic consequences of labor market feminization and gender backlash are causally connected beyond other well-known factors, such as cultural change. Using Swiss panel data and a novel shift-share instrument measuring men’s exposure to changes in the gender composition of the labor force across industries (labor market feminization), we make two contributions. First, labor market feminization negatively affects men’s income and employment prospects, making men more conservative in their gender attitudes. Second, while labor market feminization affects gender attitudes within the private sphere, in a context of low politicization of gender by political elites, it does not influence broader political outcomes like policy preferences or far-right voting. These findings reveal the sequence and mechanisms behind the distributional consequences of labor market feminization.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="cremaschi2024segregation" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">Underground Immigrant Organization: Why West African Men in Italy Withdraw into Exploited Labor Camps</div> <div class="author"> <em>Simone Cremaschi</em> </div> <div class="periodical"> 2024 </div> <div class="periodical"> </div> <div class="links"> <a class="abstract btn btn-sm z-depth-0" role="button">Abstract</a> </div> <div class="abstract hidden"> <p>I investigate how access to an organized ethnic community shapes immigrant responses to exclusion.

My fieldwork shows that when an underground community infrastructure is available, some immigrants use it as support while attempting to integrate into mainstream society. Others utilize it as a long-term shelter for withdrawal. I theorize a decision-making model and provide evidence that withdrawal (1) is driven by barriers to mainstream society rather than returns in the underground economy or coercion by exploitative agents, and (2) allows immigrants to compensate for unmet economic expectations with positive identification in the camp community.

When trying to explain the execution and timing of these attacks, most theories look at NSAGs’ internal organizational features or how these groups interact with the state or civilian population. In this study, we take a different approach: we use a self-exciting temporal model to ask if the behavior of one NSAG affects the behavior of other groups operating in the same country and if the actions of groups with actual ties (i.e., groups with some recognized relationship) have a larger effect than those with environmental ties (i.e., groups simply operating in the same country). We focus on three cases where multiple NSAGs operated at the same time: Afghanistan, Iraq, and Colombia, from 2001 to 2005. We find mixed results for the notion that the actions of one NSAG influence the actions of others operating in the same conflict. In Iraq and Afghanistan, we find evidence that NSAG actions do influence the timing of attacks by other NSAGs; however, there is no discernible link between NSAG actions and the timing of attacks in Colombia. Nevertheless, we do consistently find that there is no significant difference between the effect that actual or environmental ties could have in these three cases.</p> </div> </div> </div> </li> <li> <div class="row"> <div id="cremaschi2017diversityandcontact" class="col-sm-12"> <div class="title">Review of Karen Schönwälder, Söner Petermann, Jörg Hüttermann, Steven Vertovec, Miles Hewstone, Dietlind Stolle, Katharina Schmid, and Thomas Schmitt, “Diversity and Contact.
