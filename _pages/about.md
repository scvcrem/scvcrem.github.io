I am a political scientist researching the political economy of **inclusion** and the **provision of public goods** in liberal democracies. I work as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Bocconi University's [Department of Social and Political Sciences](https://sps.unibocconi.eu/) and [Dondena Centre](https://dondena.unibocconi.eu/research-areas/politics-and-institutions-unit).

**research.** My work examines political conflicts over material resources — such as competition for **access to public services** along ethnic and territorial lines, and the **exploitation of migrant labor** in globalized agriculture — and how **community narratives** and **collective memories** shape these struggles, enabling exclusionary as well as pro-democratic mobilization. I combine diverse methods and types of evidence, often involving extensive qualitative fieldwork and design-based causal inference, while also developing new approaches to integrate the two. 

**impact.** My research is published or forthcoming in leading political science journals, including the *American Political Science Review*, *American Journal of Political Science*, *Journal of Politics*, and *Comparative Political Studies*, and has been featured in major media outlets like the [*Financial Times*](https://www.ft.com/content/6b3e2ee0-189e-47f4-95df-375d79dd6266), the [*New York Times*](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/10/business/economy/uk-riots-economy.html?smid=nytcore-android-share) and [*The Guardian*](https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/article/2024/aug/02/europe-far-right-labour-nhs-nigel-farage?CMP=share_btn_url). My PhD received the [IMISCOE Maria Ioannis Baganha Award](https://www.imiscoe.org/news-and-blog/news/network-news/1345-maria-baganha-award-winner-2021-simone-cremaschi) for the best dissertation on migration, integration, and social cohesion in Europe. All my [publications](https://simonecremaschi.com/publications/) are available on this site.

**vita.** I received my PhD in Political and Social Sciences from the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences) and have spent visiting periods at [Columbia University](https://sociology.columbia.edu/), the [WZB Berlin](https://wzb.eu/en), [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/de.html) with the [Immigration Policy Lab](https://immigrationlab.org/), and Bocconi University. My research has been generously funded by the [United Nations World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER)](https://www.wider.unu.edu/project/institutional-legacies-violent-conflict), [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/), and [Fondazione Roberto Franceschi](https://www.fondfranceschi.it/). I have collaborated on [social](https://simonecremaschi.com/action/) and [research dissemination](https://simonecremaschi.com/media/) projects with civil society organizations such as [Fondazione Roberto Franceschi](https://www.fondfranceschi.it/), [Associazione Naga](https://naga.it/), and [Fondazione Giangiacomo Feltrinelli](https://fondazionefeltrinelli.it/). For more details, see my [curriculum vitae](https://simonecremaschi.com/assets/pdf/cv_web.pdf).

<!--- **research.** My research investigates the micro-foundations of political conflict over immigration and its interactions with macro societal change and group identities. I address the following key questions:

*immigrant exploitation and ethnic boundary making.* How demand for exploited farm labor enables immigrants' underground organization and shapes their ethnic community choices;

*access to public services and support for the far-right.* How public service deprivation generates a lasting sense of abandonment by the state and strenghtens support for anti-immigrant political platforms;

*collective memory and anti-fascism.* How local communities preserve memories of armed resistance to fascism and mobilize them to counter contemporary far-right pressures;

 *the electoral consequences of climate change.* Why climate-related natural disasters may fail to increase support for environmental policy and instead strenghten far-right parties.

I combine multiple types of methods and evidence, often involving extensive qualitative fieldwork and design-based causal inference, and developing new approaches to combine the two. --->
