I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Bocconi University, [Dondena Centre](https://dondena.unibocconi.eu/research-areas/politics-and-institutions-unit), studying topics in political sociology, comparative political economy, and public policy. From January to June 2024, I will be a visiting fellow at [Columbia University, Department of Sociology](https://sociology.columbia.edu/).

**research.** My research agenda currently focuses on three main topics:

*immigrant marginalization and ethnic boundary making*. I show that informality creates opportunities for communal organization among severely marginalized immigrants, and study how these underground ethnic communities shape individual's adaptation strategies. I argue that self-organized immigrant camps across Europe provide a space where the most marginalized immigrants can withdraw and cultivate a distinct identity. 

*public service provision and exclusionary politics*. Together with [Catherine De Vries](https://www.catherinedevries.eu/) and fellow co-authors, I study how local public services shape people's perceptions of the state and their voting choices. We argue that reductions of public service in Western democracies have fostered support for far-right parties.

*collective memory and political mobilization.* Together with [Juan Masullo](https://www.juanmasullo.com/), I study how the memory of the Italian partisan resistance against Nazi-fascism continues to shape anti-fascist mobilization. We argue that local communities can transmit historically defining experiences across generations, activating them when core values are perceived to be under threat.

My research combines multiple types of methods and evidence, often involving extensive qualitative fieldwork and design-based causal inference, and developing new approaches to combine the two.

**vitae.** I received my PhD in Political and Social Sciences from the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences). My PhD has won the 2021 [IMISCOE Maria Ioannis Baganha Award](https://www.imiscoe.org/news-and-blog/news/network-news/1345-maria-baganha-award-winner-2021-simone-cremaschi) as the best dissertation on migration, integration, and social cohesion in Europe. My research has won funding from the [United Nations World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER)](https://www.wider.unu.edu/project/institutional-legacies-violent-conflict), [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/), and [Fondazione Roberto Franceschi](https://www.fondfranceschi.it/). I have spent visiting periods at the [WZB Berlin](https://wzb.eu/en), [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/de.html)-[Immigration Policy Lab](https://immigrationlab.org/), and Bocconi University. I have collaborated on social and research dissemination projects with civil society organizations such as [Fondazione Roberto Franceschi](https://www.fondfranceschi.it/), [Associazione Naga](https://naga.it/), and [Fondazione Giangiacomo Feltrinelli](https://fondazionefeltrinelli.it/).
