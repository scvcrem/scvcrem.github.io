I am a political sociologist studying the origins, workings, and consequences of social and political marginalization. I am a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Bocconi University, [Dondena Centre](https://dondena.unibocconi.eu/research-areas/politics-and-institutions-unit), where I am part of the [ERC Project LOSS](https://dondena.unibocconi.eu/research-projects/loss). 

**research.** My research currently focuses on the following three broad lines of enquiry:

- ***immigrant marginality:*** how immigrants create parallel institutional infrastructures to survive poverty and marginalization, and how institutional parallelism shapes their relationships with dominant groups

- ***exclusionary politics:*** how macro-societal changes such as economic crises, the gender revolution, and climate change shape the demand for policies that harm marginalized groups in Europe

- ***collective memory:*** how collective memories of past events, such as wartime resistance, are transmitted and mobilized to inform current political dynamics and intergroup relationships

My research combines multiple types of methods and evidence, often involving extensive qualitative fieldwork and design-based causal inference, and developing new approaches to combine the two.

**vitae.** I received my PhD in Political and Social Sciences from the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences). My PhD has won the 2021 [IMISCOE Maria Ioannis Baganha Award](https://www.imiscoe.org/news-and-blog/news/network-news/1345-maria-baganha-award-winner-2021-simone-cremaschi) as the best dissertation on migration, integration, and social cohesion in Europe. My research has won funding from the [United Nations World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER)](https://www.wider.unu.edu/project/institutional-legacies-violent-conflict), [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/), and [Fondazione Roberto Franceschi](https://www.fondfranceschi.it/). During my PhD, I have spent visiting periods at the [WZB Berlin](https://wzb.eu/en), [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/de.html)-[Immigration Policy Lab](https://immigrationlab.org/), and Bocconi University. From January to June 2024, I will be a visiting fellow at [Columbia University](https://sociology.columbia.edu/).
