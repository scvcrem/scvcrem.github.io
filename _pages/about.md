I am a political sociologist studying the origins, workings, and consequences of social and political marginalization. I work as a Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Bocconi University, [Dondena Centre](https://dondena.unibocconi.eu/research-areas/politics-and-institutions-unit), where I am part of the [ERC Project LOSS](https://dondena.unibocconi.eu/research-projects/loss). 

**research.** My current research follows three intersecting lines:

*ethnic marginality.* How immigrants and minority groups create parallel institutional infrastructures to survive poverty and exclusion, and how such institutional parallelism shapes their relationship with the mainstream society;

*exclusionary politics.* How macro-societal changes such as economic crises, the gender revolution, and climate change create demand for policies that harm marginalized groups such as immigrants and women in Europe, and how local variation in state-provided public services shapes this relationship;

*inclusive memories.* How collective memories of historical events such as wartime resistance against Nazi-Fascism are transmitted and mobilized today to defend the rights of marginalized groups and create more inclusive societies.

My research combines multiple types of methods and evidence, often involving extensive qualitative fieldwork and design-based causal inference, and developing new approaches to combine the two.

**vitae.** I received my PhD in Political and Social Sciences from the [European University Institute](https://www.eui.eu/en/academic-units/political-and-social-sciences). My PhD has won the 2021 [IMISCOE Maria Ioannis Baganha Award](https://www.imiscoe.org/news-and-blog/news/network-news/1345-maria-baganha-award-winner-2021-simone-cremaschi) as the best dissertation on migration, integration, and social cohesion in Europe. My research has won funding from the [United Nations World Institute for Development Economics Research (UNU-WIDER)](https://www.wider.unu.edu/project/institutional-legacies-violent-conflict), [Leiden University](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/), and [Fondazione Roberto Franceschi](https://www.fondfranceschi.it/). During my PhD, I have spent visiting periods at the [WZB Berlin](https://wzb.eu/en), [ETH Zurich](https://ethz.ch/de.html)-[Immigration Policy Lab](https://immigrationlab.org/), and Bocconi University. From January to June 2024, I will be a visiting fellow at [Columbia University](https://sociology.columbia.edu/).
