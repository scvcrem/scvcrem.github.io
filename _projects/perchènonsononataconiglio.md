*Perchè Non Sono Nata Coniglio* is a novel (in Italian) telling the story of Lydia Buticchi Franceschi, mother of Roberto, a Bocconi student and activist shot in the back of the head by a police weapon on 23 January 50 years ago (1973). The book is authored by N23, a collective including doctors, lawyers, journalists, playwrights, actresses, professors, musicians, friends, united by the desire to make her story known and preserve her memory, of which I have the honor to be part.
